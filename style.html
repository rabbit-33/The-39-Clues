Patton. <br/> Grace tells Patton the information in the letter and Patton tells Grace about the Vespers that they some aren't related by blood (similar to the Madrigals, like how they recruit people from other branches) but they all have the same goal, world domination.
Grace then tries <br/> to find the answer for the mysterious letter she found and sees that the letter was talking about the eye of a bull statue in the Torch Cafe. When she finds that nothing is in there, Patton tells her that a Vesper agent beat them to the ring. Grace sees a bulge in Patton's pocket and discovers <br/> that he is the Vesper agent.
While Patton is sleeping, Grace steals the ring and tells the guards that she is anxious to get moving and wants to go. The guards take her to Lisbon, where she is now under protected ground. When Patton wakes up, he discovers that he has been beaten <br/> by a thirteen year old girl and is infuriated.
Grace then goes home, reunited with baby Fiske.

The agents show the Cahills an image of Sinead stealing a genetically modified version of goat pox, one that affects humans. The Cahills then accept the job the CIA agents have for them, to capture Sinead and stop an outbreak, hence the title Outbreak. One team, Cara, Ian, Hamilton and Jonah go to Sinead's previous house. The other, to Havana, Cuba to find both Sinead and Dr. Miller, the creator of the modified goat pox. Team one is in Sinead's old base or lab when a bunch of people bust in with hazmat suits and weapons. Things take a turn for the worst when they accidentally get infected with the modified goat pox. Then it is revealed here that Sinead would do something to cure the Outbreak herself, as she wanted to redeem herself. After that, she goes to the promenade to dance and breathe the fresh air off the ocean. The people around her were dancing, so she decided to do the same to avoid suspicion. Then, she inconspicuously dropped a vial containing the modified goat pox onto the sand. She then covered her nose and mouth and stepped on it, crushing it. Team two was in Havana where they finally located Dr. Nueman's apartment. An ex-Cahill who had fled to Cuba on their side instead of siding with Grace in America during the Cuban Revolution.

    Operation Trinity
    <h6>
    It follows the story of a boy named Matheus Jacobs. One day, on a seemingly peaceful day, a messenger from King Philip of France sent a letter. After reading it, his father and mother, Joost and Anna, went for a private talk with Matheus. They explained why they want him to become an altar boy: Jan Van Eyck's altarpiece needs to be protected from the Vespers, the rebellion on that time probably caused by them so they had a chance to steal it, and the only way to protect it is to stay close with the object by becoming an altar boy. So, Matheus set off to Ghent, to Saint Bavo Cathedral. That night, after he arrives and tried to get sleep, he sneaks outside to see the altarpiece, and meets with Father Gerard. The next day, Father asks him to send a package for an errand. On his way, he meets with mobs, and goes back home to his parents, to see if they are safe. In reunion time, Matheus meets with a black-hooded man, who he saw from the crowd of mobs. He kills Anna, and escapes. Matheus rushes to Ghent to save the altarpiece before the Vespers take it. He works together with Father Gerard to hide the paintings in the bell tower, before the mobs could destroy it. The next morning, the riot is over. Matheus and Father Gerard return the altarpiece back. It seems that the Vespers want the altarpiece because it contains a map to something unimaginable--there are some Hebrew symbols that will give away the information if they are translated correctly.
    It follows the story of Grace Cahill, after the events of taking Gideon's ring from George Patton on ongoing war. One day, she receives two letters, one is from her favorite teacher, Timothy Blythe, who joined the army. The letter talks about the altarpiece who have gone missing for years, and she has to locate it. At Miss Harper's School of Girls, there's a new teacher of art history, Mademoiselle Hubert. She teaches the girls, and gets a full attention to Grace. On a slide showing the altarpiece, the teacher snatches the letter from Mr. Blythe from Grace. Later, Grace sneaks into her office to retrieve it. She finds a letter from V4 to Hubert, saying that they got the altarpiece and it seems Hubert replaced her old teacher, just to gain information of the altarpiece before killing her. There was a shootout, and Grace survives. Then she goes to Paris, to meet Rosa Valland, the curator of the Louvre museum, by sneaking into a Navy boat. Rosa tells her that the altarpiece contains a secret, and it's now with the Nazis in Austria. She is asked to rescue the altarpiece before the Nazis destroy it. Jane Sperling takes Grace to Luftwaffe, German Air Force. From there, she works alone. She hides in a wagon that carried dynamites to a mine, possibly a place where the altarpiece is kept. She is right. After she got out of the wagon and into a cart to the mine, she finds the altarpiece. She decided to block the cave and wait for the Allies to come, and the plan works. She succeeds in saving the altarpiece.
    In an auction house, Ian bids 16,400,000 pounds for the Self Portrait of Jan Van Eyck, and wins the auction. He later got picked up by Isabel on a helicopter. Isabel has a mission for them in Belgium, to take some files from the University of Ghent. They do, but they are caught. Ian realizes his mother forgot to send backup. However, he and Natalie track her down. The mission to retrieve the files at the University of Ghent is actually a diversion for Isabel to destroy the altarpiece. She is just about to destroy the altarpiece when Grace walks in and threatens them. Ian tells his mother not to, and she brings them out. On the way, Ian looks at Grace, who winks at him. Grace is left alone and begins to scan the altarpiece. She discovers important information, which is not revealed. "They will move the earth" is the message she scanned on the altarpiece. She takes a final look at it, then heads back to Massachusetts.
